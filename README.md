## Overview

This repository showcases a variety of Python applications, including face detection, image processing, and more. It aims to help users understand how to implement different functionalities using Python libraries and frameworks.

## Applications

### Face Detection App
This application uses OpenCV and `facenet_pytorch` to perform real-time face detection through a webcam. It can identify faces in live video feed and display whether a face is detected or not.

### Other Applications
- Add details of other applications here (e.g., image processing, machine learning models, etc.)

## Installation

To run the applications, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` file provided.
