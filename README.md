## Overview

This repository showcases a variety of Python applications, including face detection, image processing, and more. It aims to help users understand how to implement different functionalities using Python libraries and frameworks.

## Applications

  * ### Face Detection App [➡️](https://github.com/jaymoundekar18/Python_Applications/blob/main/Face%20Detection/README.md)
      - This application uses OpenCV and `facenet_pytorch` to perform real-time face detection through a webcam. It can identify faces in live video feed and display whether a face is detected or not.

  * ### Face Extraction App [➡️](https://github.com/jaymoundekar18/Python_Applications/blob/main/Face%20Extraction/README.md)
      - Extracting face from uploaded image and from the contineous live video feed (web cam)

  * ### Camera App [➡️](https://github.com/jaymoundekar18/Python_Applications/blob/main/Camera%20App/README.md)
      - Simple camera app using ```opencv```

  * ### Face Analysis App [➡️](https://github.com/jaymoundekar18/Python_Applications/blob/main/Face_Analysis/README.md)
      - Analyzing facial attributes through live video feed and from uploaded image and displaying the facial features on the screen.

  * ### Login App [➡️](https://github.com/jaymoundekar18/Python_Applications/blob/main/Login%20App/README.md)
      - Simple Login Application using ```custom-tkinter``` and ```sqlite3```.
