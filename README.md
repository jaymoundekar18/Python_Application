## Overview

This repository showcases a variety of Python applications, including face detection, image processing, and more. It aims to help users understand how to implement different functionalities using Python libraries and frameworks.

## Applications

  * ### Face Detection App [➡️](https://github.com/jaymoundekar18/Python_Applications/blob/main/Face%20Detection/README.md)
      - This application uses `OpenCV` and `facenet_pytorch` to perform real-time face detection through a webcam. It can identify faces in live video feed and display whether a face is detected or not.

  * ### Face Extraction App [➡️](https://github.com/jaymoundekar18/Python_Applications/blob/main/Face%20Extraction/README.md)
      - This application uses `OpenCV` and `facenet_pytorch` leveraging [MTCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02878) to perform face detection on selected image and extract them into smaller cropped faces displayed on the interface.

  * ### Camera App [➡️](https://github.com/jaymoundekar18/Python_Applications/blob/main/Camera%20App/README.md)
      - A Camera App built using `Python` and `CustomTkinter`, providing a live camera feed and the ability to capture and save images directly from the video stream.

  * ### Face Analysis App [➡️](https://github.com/jaymoundekar18/Python_Applications/blob/main/Face_Analysis/README.md)
      - A Face Analysis Application developed using `Python`, `CustomTkinter`, and `DeepFace` to analyze facial features such as **emotion**, **age**, **gender**, **race**, and **face confidence**. The app supports both live camera feed and static image analysis.

  * ### Login App [➡️](https://github.com/jaymoundekar18/Python_Applications/blob/main/Login%20App/README.md)
      - This project is a desktop application built using `CustomTkinter`, `SQLite`, `OpenCV`, and `Pillow` for user login and registration. It features a sleek and modern UI with the following functionalities: **User Registration**, **User Login**, **Password Visibility Toggle**, **Dynamic Screen Transition**.
