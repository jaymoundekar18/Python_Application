# Face Detection using Facenet Pytorch

This project is GUI based **Face Detection Application** using __Python__. It uses the facenet-pytorch library for face detection and customtkinter for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). The app displays a live camera feed and allows you to detect faces in real-time.

## Features
1. **Live Camera Feed**: Streams real-time video from the default webcam.
2. **Face Detection**: Highlights faces in the camera feed with bounding boxes.
3. **Start/Stop Detection**: Easily enable or disable face detection.
4. **User-Friendly GUI**: Simple and dark-themed interface built with customtkinter.

## Installation
### Prerequisits
Ensure you have Python installed (version **3.8** or later).

### Install Required Libraries
Install all dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Use the following command:
```python
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 
1. **Run the Application**:
     * Execute the Python script in your terminal or IDE:
```python
python Face_Detection.py
```
2. **Start Face Detection**:
    * Click the "Start Detection" button to enable face detection.
    * Detected faces will be highlighted with green rectangles.

3. **Stop Face Detection**:
    * Click the "Stop Detection" button to pause face detection.

4. **Close the App**:
    * Click the "Close App" button to stop the video stream and exit the application.
